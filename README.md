This repository hosts open tools that are useful for debugging issues on AMD systems.

## Installation
It is suggested to install tools in a virtual environment either using
`pipx` or `python3 -m venv`.

### From PyPI
`amd-debug-tools` is distributed as a python wheel, which is a
binary package format for Python. To install from PyPI, run the following
command:

    pipx install amd-debug-tools

### From source
To build the package from source, you will need to the `python3-build`
package natively installed by your distribution package manager. Then you
can generate and install a wheel by running the following commands:

    python3 -m build
    pipx install dist/amd-debug-tools-*.whl

### Ensuring path
If you have not used a `pipx` environment before, you may need to run the following command
to set up the environment:

    pipx ensurepath

This will add the `pipx` environment to your path.

### Running in tree
If you want to run the tools in tree, you need to make sure that distro dependencies
that would normally install into a venv are installed. This can be done by running:

    ./install_deps.py

After dependencies are installed, you can run the tools by running:

    ./amd_s2idle.py
    ./amd_bios.py
    ./amd_pstate.py

## amd-s2idle
`amd-s2idle` is a tool used for analyzing the entry and exit of the s2idle
state of a Linux system.

It is intended to use with Linux kernel 6.1 or later and works by hooking
into dynamic debugging messages and events that are generated by the kernel.

For analysis of power consumption issues it can be hooked into `systemd` to
run a command to capture data right before and after the system enters and
exits the s2idle state.

4 high level commands are supported.

### `amd-s2idle install`
This will install the systemd hook so that data will be captured before and
after the system enters and exits the s2idle state.

This will also install a bash completion script that can be used for other
commands.

**NOTE:** This command is only supported when run from a venv.

### `amd-s2idle uninstall`
This will uninstall the systemd hook and remove the bash completion script.

**NOTE:** This command is only supported when run from a venv.

### `amd-s2idle test`
This will run a suspend cycle with a timer based wakeup and capture relevant
data into a database and produce a report. This can also be used to run multiple cycles.

The following optional arguments are supported for this command:

        --count COUNT         Number of cycles to run
        --duration DURATION   Duration of the cycle in seconds
        --wait WAIT           Time to wait before starting the cycle in seconds
        --format FORMAT       Format of the report to produce (html, txt or md)
        --report-file         File to write the report to
        --force               Run a test cycle even if the system fails to pass prerequisite checks
        --random              Run sleep cycles for random durations and waits, using the --duration and --wait arguments as an upper bound
        --logind              Use logind to suspend the system
        --tool-debug          Enable debug logging
        --bios-debug          Enable BIOS debug logging instead of notify logging

If the tool is launched with an environment that can call `xdg-open`, the report
will be opened in a browser.

### `amd-s2idle report`
This will produce a report from the data captured by the `test` command
and/or from the systemd hook.  The report will default to 60 days of data.

The following optional arguments are supported for this command:

        --since SINCE         Date to start the report from
        --until UNTIL         Date to end the report at
        --format FORMAT       Format of the report to produce (html, txt or md)
        --report-file         File to write the report to
        --tool-debug          Enable tool debug logging
        --report-debug        Include debug messages in the report

If the tool is launched with an environment that can call `xdg-open`, the report
will be opened in a browser.

### `amd-s2idle version`
This will print the version of the tool and exit.

### Debug output
All commands support the `--tool-debug` argument which will enable extra debug output. This is often needed for debugging issues with a particular cycle.

**NOTE:** enabling debug output significantly increases the size of the report.
It's suggested that you use `--since` and `--until` to focus on the cycles that you are interested in.

## amd-bios
`amd-bios` is a a tool that can be used to enable or disable BIOS AML debug logging
-and to parse a kernel log that contains BIOS logs.

### `amd-bios trace`
Modify BIOS AML trace debug logging.

One of the following arguments must be set for this command:

        --enable       Enable BIOS AML tracing
        --disable      Disable BIOS AML tracing

The following optional arguments are supported for this command:

        --tool-debug   Enable tool debug logging

### `amd-bios parse`
Parses a kernel log that contains BIOS AML debug logging and produces a report.

The following optional arguments are supported for this command:

        --input INPUT  Optional input file to parse
        --tool-debug   Enable tool debug logging

### `amd-bios version`
This will print the version of the tool and exit.

## amd-pstate
`amd-pstate` is a tool used for identification of issues with amd-pstate.
It will capture some state from the system as well as from the machine specific registers that
amd-pstate uses.

## Compatibility scripts

Compatibility scripts are provided for the previous names the tools went by:
`amd_s2idle.py`, `amd_bios.py` and `amd_pstate.py`.
These allow cloning the repository and running the scripts without installing
the package.
